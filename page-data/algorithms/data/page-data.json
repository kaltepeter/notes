It is a generalized form of the binary search tree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is also known as a height-balanced m-way tree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-- <a href=\"https://www.programiz.com/dsa/b-tree\">https://www.programiz.com/dsa/b-tree</a></p>\n<h3>B+-tree</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A B+ tree is an advanced form of a self-balancing tree in which all the values are present in the leaf level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An important concept to be understood before learning B+ tree is multilevel indexing. In multilevel indexing, the index of indices is created as in figure below. It makes accessing the data easier and faster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-- <a href=\"https://www.programiz.com/dsa/b-plus-tree\">https://www.programiz.com/dsa/b-plus-tree</a></p>\n<h2>Distance Calculations</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 19, 2020","title":"Algorithms and Data Structures","tags":["cs","data"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/algorithms/data/"}},
