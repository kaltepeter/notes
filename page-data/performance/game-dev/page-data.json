You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rule 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rule 5. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's famous maxim \"Premature optimization is the root of all evil.\" Ken Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as \"When in doubt, use brute force.\". Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the design philosophy KISS. Rule 5 was previously stated by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. Rule 5 is often shortened to \"write stupid code that uses smart objects\".\n-- <a href=\"https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html\">https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Red Blob Games</h2>\n<p>Really great visuals and walk-through on algorithms and math subjects focussed around game dev.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/\">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html\">https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html\">https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 11, 2021","title":"Game Dev","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/performance/game-dev/"}},
