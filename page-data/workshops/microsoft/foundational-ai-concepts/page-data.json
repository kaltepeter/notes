This is squaring the actual values and calculating mean. This is used when more small errors are more desirable than larger but fewer errors. e.g. (which are 4, 9, 9, 1, 4, and 9) is 6</p>\n<h3>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</h3>\n<p>The result of MSE no longer represents the quantity measured by the label. To measure in terms of number, take the square root of the MSE. e.g.  √6, which is 2.45</p>\n<h3>Coefficient of Determination (R-Squared)</h3>\n<p>A metric that measures the proportion of variance in the validation results that can be explained by the model, as opposed to some anomalous aspect of the validation data.</p>\n<p>The calculation for R2 is more complex than for the previous metrics. It compares the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual labels with the sum of squared differences between the actual label values and the mean of actual label values.</p>\n<p>$$ R^2 = {1 - \\sum(y - \\hat{y})^2 \\div \\sum(y-\\bar{y})^2} $$</p>\n<p>A number between 0 and 1.

Often, color-intensity is used to indicate the number of predictions in each cell, so a quick glance at a model that predicts well should reveal a deeply shaded diagonal trend.</p>\n<h3>Accuracy</h3>\n<p>The simplest metric you can calculate from the confusion matrix is accuracy - the proportion of predictions that the model got right</p>\n<p>$$ (TN + TP) \\div (TN + FN + FP + TP) $$</p>\n<p>e.g. 0.83</p>\n<h3>Recall</h3>\n<p>Recall is a metric that measures the proportion of positive cases that the model identified correctly. i.e. How many did the model predict to be positive?</p>\n<p>$$ TP \\div (TP + FN) $$</p>\n<p>e.g. 0.75</p>\n<h2>Precision</h2>\n<p>Similar metric to recall, but measures the proportion of predicted positive cases where the true label is actually positive. i.e. What proportion of the positive predictions were correct?</p>\n<p>$$ TP \\div (TP + FP) $$</p>\n<p>e.g. 1.0</p>\n<h2>F1-score</h2>\n<p>F1-score is the overall metric that combined recall and precision.</p>\n<p>$$ (2 x Precision x Recall) \\div (Precision + Recall) $$</p>\n<p>e.g. 0.86</p>\n<h2>Area Under the Curve (AUC)</h2>\n<p>Another name for recall is the true positive rate (TPR), and there's an equivalent metric called the false positive rate (FPR).</p>\n<p>$$ FPR = FP \\div (FP + TN) $$</p>\n<p>e.g. FPR 0</p>\n<p>These metrics are often used to evaluate a model by plotting a received operator characteristic (ROC) curve that compares the TPR and FPR for every possible threshold value between 0.0 and 1.0</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 300px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/notes/static/e5710c0b2898989d71a863b196c2632b/5a46d/microsoft-area-under-curver.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 87.73006134969326%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Area Under the Curve\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/notes/static/e5710c0b2898989d71a863b196c2632b/5a46d/microsoft-area-under-curver.png\"\n        srcset=\"/notes/static/e5710c0b2898989d71a863b196c2632b/222b7/microsoft-area-under-curver.png 163w,\n/notes/static/e5710c0b2898989d71a863b196c2632b/5a46d/microsoft-area-under-curver.png 300w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The ROC curve for a perfect model would go straight up the TPR axis on the left and then across the FPR axis at the top. Since the plot area for the curve measures 1x1, the area under this perfect curve would be 1.0 (meaning that the model is correct 100% of the time). In contrast, a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right represents the results that would be achieved by randomly guessing a binary label; producing an area under the curve of 0.5. In other words, given two possible class labels, you could reasonably expect to guess correctly 50% of the time.</p>\n<p>In the case of our diabetes model, the curve above is produced, and the area under the curve (AUC) metric is 0.875. Since the AUC is higher than 0.5, we can conclude the model performs better at predicting whether or not a patient has diabetes than randomly guessing.</p>\n<h2>Multiclass Classification</h2>\n<p>Multiclass classification is used to predict to which of multiple possible classes an observation belongs. As a supervised machine learning technique, it follows the same iterative train, validate, and evaluate process as regression and binary classification in which a subset of the training data is held back to validate the trained model.</p>\n<h3>Algorithms</h3>\n<h4>One-vs-Rest (OvR) algorithms</h4>\n<p>One-vs-Rest algorithms train a binary classification function for each class, each calculating the probability that the observation is an example of the target class.</p>\n<p>$$ f^0(x) = P(y=0 | x) $$\n$$ f^1(x) = P(y=1 | x) $$\n$$ f^2(x) = P(y=2 | x) $$</p>\n<p>Each algorithm produces a sigmoid function that calculates a probability value between 0.0 and 1.0</p>\n<h4>Multinomial algorithms</h4>\n<p>As an alternative approach is to use a multinomial algorithm, which creates a single function that returns a multi-valued output. The output is a vector (an array of values) that contains the probability distribution for all possible classes - with a probability score for each class which when totaled add up to 1.0</p>\n<p>$$ f(x) = [P(y=0|x), P(y=1|x), P(y=2|x)] $$</p>\n<p>e.g. [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]</p>\n<h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>\n<p>Create a confustion matrix with all possibilities.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>0</th>\n<th>1</th>\n<th>2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>$ x\\ axis = \\hat{y},\\ y\\ axis = y $</p>\n<p>To calculate the overall accuracy, recall, and precision metrics, you use the total of the TP, TN, FP, and FN metrics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall accuracy = (13+6)÷(13+6+1+1) = 0.90</li>\n<li>Overall recall = 6÷(6+1) = 0.86</li>\n<li>Overall precision = 6÷(6+1) = 0.86</li>\n<li>Overall F1-score = (2x0.86x0.86)÷(0.86+0.86) = 0.86</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Clustering</h2>\n<p>Clustering is a form of unsupervised machine learning in which observations are grouped into clusters based on similarities in their data values, or features. This kind of machine learning is considered unsupervised because it doesn't make use of previously known label values to train a model. In a clustering model, the label is the cluster to which the observation is assigned, based only on its features.</p>\n<p>There are multiple algorithms you can use for clustering. One of the most commonly used algorithms is K-Means clustering, which consists of the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feature (x) values are vectorized to define n-dimensional coordinates. (n is number of features)</li>\n<li>you decide how many clusters you want to use. Call this k.</li>\n<li>Each data point is assigned to its nearest centroid</li>\n<li>Each centroid is moved to the center of the data points assigned to it based on the mean distance between points.</li>\n<li>After each centroid is moved, the data points are reassigned to the nearest centroid.</li>\n<li>The centroid movement and re-allocation steps are repeated until the cluster become stable or a predetermined number of iterations is reached.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>\n<p>Since there's no known label with which to compare the predicted cluster assignments, evaluation of a clustering model is based on how well the resulting clusters are separated from one another.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Average distance to cluster center: How close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroid of the cluster.</li>\n<li>Average distance to other center: How close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroid of all other clusters.</li>\n<li>Maximum distance to cluster center: The furthest distance between a point in the cluster and its centroid.</li>\n<li>Silhouette: A value between -1 and 1 that summarizes the ratio of distance between points in the same cluster and points in different clusters (The closer to 1, the better the cluster separation).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deep Learning</h2>\n<p>Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning that tries to emulate the way the human brain learns. The key to deep learning is the creation of an artificial neural network that simulates electrochemical activity in biological neurons by using mathematical functions</p>\n<p>Artificial neural networks are made up of multiple layers of neurons - essentially defining a deeply nested function. This architecture is the reason the technique is referred to as deep learning and the models produced by it are often referred to as deep neural networks (DNNs). You can use deep neural networks for many kinds of machine learning problem, including regression and classification, as well as more specialized models for natural language processing and computer vision.</p>\n<h3>how doea a neural network learn?</h3>\n<p>The weights in a neural network are central to how it calculates predicted values for labels. During the training process, the model learns the weights that will result in the most accurate predictions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Training and validation data are defined. Training features are fed into the input layer</li>\n<li>The neurons in each layer apply their weights, initially assigned randomly, and feed data through the network.</li>\n<li>The output layer produces a vecotr containing the calculated values for $ \\hat{y}$</li>\n<li>A loss function is used to compare the predicted $ \\hat{y}$ to known $y$ values and aggregates the difference. Known as loss.</li>\n<li>An optimization function can use differential calculus to evalute the influence of each weight in the network on the loss and determine how they could be adjusted to reduce the loss. Techniques vary, common is gradient descent, where each weight is increased/decreased to minimize loss.</li>\n<li>The changes are backpropagated to layers in the network, replacing previously used values</li>\n<li>The process is repeated over multiple iterations (epochs) until the loss is minimized and the model predicts acceptably accurate results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Azure Machine Learning</h2>\n<p>Cloud service for training, deploying, and managing machine learning models.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Centralized storage and management of datasets for model training and evaluation.</li>\n<li>On-demand compute resources on which you can run machine learning jobs, such as training a model.</li>\n<li>Automated machine learning (AutoML), which makes it easy to run multiple training jobs with different algorithms and parameters to find the best model for your data.</li>\n<li>Visual tools to define orchestrated pipelines for processes such as model training or inferencing.</li>\n<li>Integration with common machine learning frameworks such as MLflow, which make it easier to manage model training, evaluation, and deployment at scale.</li>\n<li>Built-in support for visualizing and evaluating metrics for responsible AI, including model explainability, fairness assessment, and others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Azure Machine Learning Studio</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Import and explore data.</li>\n<li>Create and use compute resources.</li>\n<li>Run code in notebooks.</li>\n<li>Use visual tools to create jobs and pipelines.</li>\n<li>Use automated machine learning to train models.</li>\n<li>View details of trained models, including evaluation metrics, responsible AI information, and training parameters.</li>\n<li>Deploy trained models for on-request and batch inferencing.</li>\n<li>Import and manage models from a comprehensive model catalog.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 05, 2024","title":"Microsoft: Fundamental AI Concepts","tags":["course","AI","Microsoft"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/workshops/microsoft/foundational-ai-concepts/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1796642556","2356112386","3489759178"],"slicesMap":{}}
