So if you want to get a bad initial load performance then it’s the way to go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, if we split commonly used code across lazy loaded modules then a new shared chunk will be created and will be loaded only if any of those lazy modules are loaded. This should improve the application initial load. But do it wisely because sometimes it’s better to put small code in one chunk that having the extra request needed for a separate chunk load.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/angular-in-depth/angular-code-splitting-or-how-to-share-components-between-lazy-modules-432c755e389c\">https://medium.com/angular-in-depth/angular-code-splitting-or-how-to-share-components-between-lazy-modules-432c755e389c</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 11, 2021","title":"Performance","tags":["ui","angular"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/angular/performance/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
