### npm init

simple and built in

[https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init)

[https://github.com/npm/init-package-json](https://github.com/npm/init-package-json)

`npm init <initializer>`can be used to set up a new or existing npm package.

`initializer`in this case is an npm package named`create-<initializer>`, which will be installed by[`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npx), and then have its main bin executed -- presumably creating or updating`package.json`and running any other initialization-related operations.
