## Tree Data Structures

### B-tree

> B-tree is a special type of self-balancing search tree in which each node can contain more than one key and can have more than two children. It is a generalized form of the binary search tree.

> It is also known as a height-balanced m-way tree.

### B+-tree

>A B+ tree is an advanced form of a self-balancing tree in which all the values are present in the leaf level.

> An important concept to be understood before learning B+ tree is multilevel indexing. In multilevel indexing, the index of indices is created as in figure below. It makes accessing the data easier and faster.
