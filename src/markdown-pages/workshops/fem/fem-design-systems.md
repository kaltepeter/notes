## What is a design system?

Audience
|
Printed Materials, in store experiences, digital experiences
|
design system
|
brand: identify, mission, vision, positioning, brand colors

## Do i need a design system?

- scale vs longevity

scale: number of teams, maturity, complexity of the org, number of products, channels
longevity: stability or market and product

If you are less than a year? maybe not

### Foundations layer (fundamental)

Base branch layer

- design principles
- logo and typeface
- sound guidelines
- iconography
- illustration guidelines
- voice and tone
- photography
- motion
- layout
- elevation
- how we think about color

### Tokens (fundamental)

set of codified design decisions based on foundations. [token-name] = [token-value]

- cohesive experience
- consistent design
- ease of change
- multi platform support
- type, color, spacing, elevation, opacity, radii, volume, borders, timing

### core sytems layer (fundamental)

applys the tokens

- iconography
- layout and grid
- theming
- color systems
- type scale systems
- animations systems

### Components layers

what most people think of when thinking of design systems. reusable pars of a digital interface.

- constructed from foundations layers
- consumers care most about this
- buttons, search bars, text inputs, tabs, tooltips, breadcrumbs, radio buttons

## Pieces

### Assets

- content files
- ux and design files
- dev repos
- foundations: logo files
- tokens layer: css primitive color tokens
- core systems: sass layout system
- component: figma button component

### Processes

- communication
- goverance and testing
- contribution
- synchonization
- deprecation - maintain trust
- release and versioning
- extension & variation
- onboarding

### Documentation

explains why something is the way it is and breakdown of how to use it

- what do we believe about this?
- why do we believe this?

### Examples

| group         | Foundations                              | Tokens                            | Core                           | Component                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Assets        | Logo files                               | css primitive color tokens        | sass layout system             | figma button component                             |
| Processes     | communication between brand and ds teams | modifying th evalue of token      | deprecating an old core system | accepting component modifications from subscribers |
| Documentation | Point of view on color                   | explanation of how to name tokens | hos to use the theming system  | breakdown the pieces of a comonent                 |

## Big takeaway

- lots of confusion
  - develop a common language
- teams aren't realizing the full benefits of a systematic design practice

## Consistency

The layers gives some level of consistency. Design systems do not give this automatically.

Levels of consistency:

- The buttons in my product look the same
- All digital products we offer look and feel the same
- Every interaction a customer has with us aligns with our brand

## Efficiency

What people want from a DLS.

Levels of effiency:

- I can design of build a feature faster
- Our product organization gets to market faster
- We understand each other, common language.

## Stages

1. building v1: release it
1. growing adoption: make it easy to adopt
1. surving the teenage years: build a product team and mindset
1. evolving a healthy program: mature into stable leadership

## origin storis

- grassroots: executive leadership was uninvolved. less visibility, informal or no budget, unsanctioned team, narrow scope, low pressure to deliver
- top down: high visibility, formal budget, santioned team, broad scope, high pressure to deliver

| origin     | stage 1                                   | stage 2 | stage 3 | stage 4 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| top down   | maybe on the way                          |         |         |         |
| grassroots | multiple iterations and skunk works teams |         |         |         |

- clear location of documentation and single source

## Mature

1. educate: one-way interaction, create a shared understanding, case vision
1. engage: two-way interaciton, learn from your users, give them a say in the way your system grows, recruit adoptors and contributors
1. evolve: team effort, make the system better, iterate and test your design system assets, documenation and processes

## Stage 1

Find top left (sabateur and high influence)
imagine one year from today....
identify subscriber groups
understand subscriber metrics
design system archiologist

## stage 2

- show value to the potential subscribers and stakeholders
- growing adoption, #1 metric is level of effort to onboard a single subscriber
- what is the journey like? excitement vs frustration
- define the pieces and parts that are adoptable on their own
- define what adoption means
- health metric, client adoption
- maintaining adoption is about maintaining trust with your subscribers

## stage 3

- adding disciplines to your team
- https://sparkbox.com/foundry/design_system_consistency_versus_flexibility_design_system_constraints
- selling DS: Rick Rubin, The creative act: A way of being

## stage 4

- consistency of behavior
- trustworthy and predictable
- proactive
- cofiy the maturity
- unite a system for multiple framworks

## Stability

- authority
- tradition: the way we build
- value

## Culture

- artifacts
- espoused beliefs
- underlying assumptions
- competing values, four primary types

y: flexible to focused
x: internal to external orientation

flexible/internal: do things together (clan culture)
internal/focused: do things right (hierarchy culture)
flexible/external: do things first (adhocracy culture)
external/focused: do things fast (market culture)

## moving forward

- start how you want to end
- measure adoption first
- plan for using your gains
- discoverability
- transparency vs parity
