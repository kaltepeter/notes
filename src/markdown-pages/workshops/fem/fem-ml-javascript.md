## Basics

https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models

Overfitting: model is too close to training data, value of 1. Can't predict.

- Supervised learning: given labelled data.
- Unsupervised learning: given a dataset without labels. Use is clustering.
- Semi-supervised learning: combines supervised and unsupervised. Can achieve higher accuracy.
- Reinforcement learning: training provides rewards and punishment. Used in gaming.

## Pre-trained Models

### Finding pre-trained models

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models) and more specifically [TensorFlow.js models](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=tensorflow.js+in%3Amodels)
- [TensorFlow.js models](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models)
- [Hugging face](https://huggingface.co/models)

### Choosing a Model

- What are you building?
- Quality of the training data
- Quantity of the training data
- Can you have access to the list of classes/labels?


## Tools

- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
- [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/)
- [Brain.js](https://brain.js.org/#/)
- [ConvNetJS](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs)
- [Keras.js](https://transcranial.github.io/keras-js/#/)

## Transfer Learning

Reusing pre-trained model for a new task.

### Quick start
