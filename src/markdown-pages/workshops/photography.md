## Terms

Metering refers to using the meter in the camera or a handheld meter to help find the correct exposure for a scene. Every scene is unique and should be metered. The meter takes in the overall light in the scene and averages it so that the middle tone is 18% grey. This is often correct, but for some situations, such as strong backlight, can be misleading.

The shutter speed referes to the toal time in which the lens remains open to receive light. Most of the numbers you see are fractions of a second, so the higher the numbers are faster shutter speeds. You will also notice that the consectivite nubmers almost always halve or double, so they run 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 125, 250, 500, 1000, etc. An average shutter speed would be 60 ( or 1/60 of a second). This is because at 60 the speed is fast enough to not record the normal camera shake that occurs from depressing the shutter. Changing the speed "one stop" is to move the dial from one number to the next consecutive number.

The f-stop refers to the size of the opening of the lens. The numbers you see are always fractions of the total diameter of the lens, so the larger the number, the smaller the opening, thus with a smaller opening, a lesser amount of light reaches the film plane. e.g. 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22

Thought you cannot tell quite so easily from the numbers, the consecutive f-stops also halve or double the amount of light that enterst teh camera to hit the film. This means that changing the speed one stop is equal to changing the f-stop one stop.

If, for example, you meter a scene to be correctly exposed at a shutter speed of 30 and an f-stop of 8, that means it will still be correctly exposed at a shutter speed of 60 and an f-stop of 5.6.

## Film

- pro film has better grain structure
- tungsten 64T is for slides of artwork
- 160 pro color negative portraits

### B & W vs. Color Film

| B & W                              | Color                                      |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Silver process                     | C-41, E6                                   |
| negative has latitude of two stops | C-41 is negative "print"                   |
|                                    | E-6 is positive "slide"                    |
|                                    | C-41 makes cprint                          |
|                                    | E-6 old ilfachrome, now scan and digital   |
|                                    | E-6 or chrome, has 2/3 stop latitude       |
|                                    | Chrome has to be perfect exposure, no ever |

### Film Speed

`25`: technical film

`50`, `64`, `100`: little grain and low contrast

`160`, `200`, `320`, `400`(T-Max): medium grain, medium contrast

`800`(max), `1600`, `3200`: big grain, high contrast

### Shutter Speed, FStop, Filmspeed



### Pro Film

- finer grain
- better contrast
- refridgerated
- store in cool dry place
- kodak => warm, light yellows, pinks, oranges, better
- fuji => cool tones, green blue darker colors, better for landscapes

fogging: exposed film or paper

### Format

- 35mm x 35mm
- 120mm -> 2 1/4" med format
- 4 x 5" film large format

### Infrared

- loaded in total darkness
- store in fridge
- entriely manual camera
- shoot red filter

## Lenses

- 28-105 f-stop: 4.5 ~ 5.6
- 24-70 f-stop: 28
- zooms are slow + costly, large size, not as sharp

### Advantage of Fixed

- sharpness
- contrast, mostly better
- smaller
- faster in lowlight

### Wide Angle

- smaller than standard
- 35mm
- opens space

### Standard

- what your eyes see & format size
- the diag of film
- 50mm

### telephoto

- larger than standard
- 70 mm
- 500 mm
- magnify's and compresses

### portrait lens

- 100-105mm

## Burning and Dodging

- multigrade paper (#2)
- polycontrast paper (#2)
- filters affect contrast

00 1/2 1 1-1/2 2 2-1/2 3 3-1/2 4 4-1/2 5
<---- low contrast    high contrast---->

### Prints

- blackest black
- whitest white
- defined edge
- even borders

8 x 12 is full frame

### Burn

- longer exposure w/ cardboard

### Dodge

- less exposure w/ cardboard

## Meters

https://sekonic.com/classroom/the-benefits-of-using-light-metering/


reflective: ball in, meter face subject
incident: ball out, meter faces camera

spot meters: 1ยบ, 3ยบ, 5ยบ

### Use Light Meter

1. Turn on
1. AVG/EV = push button for no A.
1. Push ISO and set ISO by turning dial while holding button. For thicker film, set ISO 1/2 to 1/3 stop lower (e.g. 400 -> 320), neg only
1. set mode (ambient light, flash w/o cord, flash w/ cord)
1. set time dial
1. hit button on side
1. if is a fraction (1/2s = 2)

## FStop/Shutter Speed

| setting       |  -| -  | -  | -   | -  |
| ------------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| fstop         | 2.8 |  4.0 | 5.6 | 8 | 11 | 16 | 32 |
| shutter speed | 1 |  1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 | 1/16 | 1/30 | 1/60 |
| iso           | 100 | 200 | 400 | 800 | 1600 | | |

Bracketing: correct exposure, 1 stop over, 1 stop under

## Over/Under exposed negs

- developing process
- in camera

underexposed neg: thin, clear, low contrast in print

fix it in print: higher f-stop or quicktime, use a filter (high #)

overexposed: high contrast, dark
print it: lower filter, lower fstop

## Chemicals

Mix chemical at 1:4 ratio. mix 100mL chem, 400mL H2O
