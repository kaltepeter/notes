## Communication patterns

- DOM is the API
- EEV?
- Unidirectional flow, no component to component coupling

## State Management

- Router state is source of truth
- Keep state management light
- sync state between shell and MFE is a smell

## ngx-build-plus

- inherits default builder
- custom webpack
