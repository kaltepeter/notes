## A\*

> A*is a modification of Dijkstra’s Algorithm that is optimized for a single destination. Dijkstra’s Algorithm can find paths to all locations; A* finds paths to one location, or the closest of several locations. It prioritizes paths that seem to be leading closer to a goal.

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

<https://www.programiz.com/dsa/floyd-warshall-algorithm>

Find the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. Use with directed and undirected graphs. **Does not work with negative cycles**.

Floyd-Warhshall algorithm is also called as Floyd's algorithm, Roy-Floyd algorithm, Roy-Warshall algorithm, or WFI algorithm.

Uses dynamic programming.
