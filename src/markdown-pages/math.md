_first degree equations_: First degree equations, also known as linear equations, are algebraic equations that involve only one variable raised to the power of one. These equations can be written in the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are  constants and x is the variable we are solving for. -- <https://warreninstitute.org/what-are-first-degree-equations/>

_polynomial_: Polynomial comes from poly- (meaning "many") and -nomial (in this case meaning "term") ... so it says "many terms"

Can have:

- constants
- variables
- exponents, but only 0,1,2,3,...etc (positive and whole numbers)

Can be:

- that can be combined using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, except no dividing by a variable. e.g. (2/x is not valid)
