## checklist for designing data vis

- [ ] _access_ look at data and determine how to access values you need
- [ ] _chart dimensions_ declare physical chart dimensions (pixels)
- [ ] _draw canvas_ render chart and bounds
- [ ] _create scales_ create scales for every data-to-pysical attribute in chart
- [ ] _draw data_ render your data elements
- [ ] _draw peripherals_ render axes, labels, legends
- [ ] _setup interactions_ initialize event listeners and create interaction behavior

## chart usage

### line chart

- y axis over time (x axis)

### scatter plot

- relationships between two axis
- dot represents a point (could be day)
- third access could be size/color of point

### histogram

- better when wider than tall (.6-.5 of width)

### maps

> As a general rule of thumb, a variant of the Mercator, the Transverse Mercator (d3.geoTransverseMercator()) is a good bet for show- ing maps that cover one country or smaller. The Winkel Tripel (d3.geoWinkel3()) or Equal Earth (d3.geoEqualEarth()) are good bets for maps covering larger areas, such as the whole world
